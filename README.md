# What is NUISTISD?

NUISTISD is a website for NUIST that provides information about schools, departments, programs, News, Notes, activities, etc., as shown in the screenshot.
NUISTISD has two sides : the admin and the ordinary user. Everything on our website is dynamic, even the logos. We tried to use new techniques in creating a website, such as navigating, sliding, etc. We used the groups, and users to manage the privileges for users.
NUISTISD is a single-page website.
We use a database. The current version is SQLite, but we can move to any other DBMS system because Django create the model first. 

##We used Django 2.2.3, which is a high-level Python Web framework.
##CSS
##Java Script
##JQuery
##Bootstrap
