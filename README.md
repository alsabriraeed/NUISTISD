# What is NUISTISD?

NUISTISD is a website for NUIST which provide the information about schools, departments, programs, News, Notes, activities etc. as shown in the screen shot.
In NUISTISD, we have two sides : the admin and the ordinary user. Everything in our website is dynamic even the logos.  W tried to use the new techniques in creating website such as navigating, sliding, etc.  we use the groups, users to mange the privileges for users.
NUISTISD is a single page website.
We use a database. The current version is SQLite, but we can move to any other DBMS system because Django create the model first. 

###We used the Django 2.2.3 which is a high-level Python Web framework.
###CSS
###Java Script
###JQuery
###Bootstrap
